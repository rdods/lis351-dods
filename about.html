<h2>About Me</h2>

   <p class="abouttext">I am currently a Communication Arts major at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. With minors/certificates in Business, Graphic Design, and Digital Studies, I would love to work as a digital marketer with an emphasis on SEO, content writing, and UX/UI design to combine my interests in creative storytelling and designing with my analytical abilities. 
    <br><br><br>
        Last summer, I worked at an agile digital marketing/SEO agency and was exposed to many new experiences in a fast-paced and modern environment. I optimized client blogs and websites to meet up-to-date SEO standards, wrote compelling informative narratives for client websites, managed and created Facebook and Google ads, and even helped train two new employees on SEO writing! I was fortunate enough to be able to work across a variety of industries and with many different types of clients, from the medical field to construction and design companies. I really enjoyed this experience because it confirmed my love for this field and showed me how marketing can have a real, meaningful impact on the lives of small business owners. 
        <br><br><br>

Throughout my time at UW-Madison, I have been familiarized with many powerful digital marketing tools, such as the Creative Cloud suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign), HTML/CSS editors like Dreamweaver or Brackets, WordPress (for SEO and website editing), Microsoft Excel/Word/PowerPoint/Access, and HubSpot. I am certified in Google Analytics and understand the importance of basing creative decisions on available metrics and A/B testing for maximum return on investment. 
        <br><br><br>

Based on this experience, my future goal is to expand my skill set with more great opportunities so I can help even more small and mid-sized businesses achieve their growth dreams.
