<h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="Images/jellyfish_drawing.jpg" alt="Jellyfish Girl Poster Design" class="portrait">
    
   <p class="abouttext">I am a recent graduate from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a Bachelor of Science in Communication Arts. With minors/certificates in Business, Graphic Design, and Digital Studies, I would love to work as a digital content creator with an emphasis on SEO, writing, and UX/UI design.
    <br><br><br>
       Last summer, I worked at an agile digital marketing agency and gained valuable experience in many areas of online content and marketing. I optimized client blogs and websites to meet SEO standards, wrote informative narratives for client websites, managed and created Facebook and Google ads, and even trained two new employees on SEO writing! I really enjoyed this experience because it confirmed my love for this field and proved how online content can have a real, meaningful impact on the lives of consumers.
        <br><br><br>

Based on this experience, my future goal is to expand my skill set with more great opportunities so I can help educate and inform even more users. In my free time, I love reading (especially fantasy and sci-fi), drawing, and indoor gardening (i.e., collecting plants and trying to keep them alive). I greatly appreciate you taking the time to get to know me, and I hope you enjoy looking at my resume and portfolio!
