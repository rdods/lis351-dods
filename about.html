<h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="Images/rachel_seniorpic.jpeg" alt="Portrait of Rachel Dods" class="portrait">
    
   <p class="abouttext">I am currently a Communication Arts major at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. With minors/certificates in Business, Graphic Design, and Digital Studies, I would love to work as a digital marketer with an emphasis on SEO, content writing, and UX/UI design to combine my interests in creative storytelling and designing with my analytical abilities. 
    <br><br><br>
        Last summer, I worked at an agile digital marketing agency and was fortunate enough to be exposed to many new skills that I look forward to utilizing in the future. I optimized client blogs and websites to meet up-to-date SEO standards, wrote compelling informative narratives for client websites, managed and created Facebook and Google ads, and even helped train two new employees on SEO writing! I really enjoyed this experience because it confirmed my love for this field and showed me how marketing can have a real, meaningful impact on the lives of small business owners. 
        <br><br><br>

Based on this experience, my future goal is to expand my skill set with more great opportunities so I can help even more small and mid-sized businesses achieve their growth dreams. In my free time, I love reading (especially fantasy and sci-fi), drawing, and indoor gardening (which mainly consists of collecting plants and photographing them). I greatly appreciate you taking the time to get to know me, and I hope you enjoy looking at my resume and portfolio!
