<h3>Resume</h3> 

	<p> <em>Hello, my name is Rachel Dods!</em> I am a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison majoring in Communication Arts. I am pursuing minors in Business, Graphic Design, and Digital Studies. <a href="https://commarts.wisc.edu/undergraduate/">Communication Arts</a> incorporates an inter-disciplinary approach with fields such as marketing, public relations, law, and technology to prepare students for careers in advertising and marketing.</p>

<h4>Experience</h4>
    <p><strong>Volunteer Tutor.</strong> From June 2021 until the end of August 2021, I worked as an intern for Leap Clixx, an agile marketing company located in St. Louis, Mo. I focused on SEO digital marketing, such as writing Google-optimized blogs, performing keyword research, and backlinking.</p>

<h4>Skills</h4>
    <p><strong>Graphic Design:</strong> I have a Certificate/Minor in Graphic Design and have taken Digital Forms, Basic Graphic Design, History of Graphic Design and Typography, User Experience and Interface Design, and more. I am proficient in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, as well as software like Canva, Corel Painter, and Clip Studio Paint. I believe these skills will be very beneficial for designing eye-catching ads, websites, and blogs. </p>
    <p><strong>Writing and Communications:</strong> As a Communication Arts major, my strength is writing a variety of short and long form content. I also have experience writing ad copy for Facebook and Instagram ads, as well as for email marketing campaigns. Content creation with an emphasis on SEO is my specialty. </p>
