        <figcaption>For Art 575 (User Experience/User Interface Design), I designed an app called MadNet (Madison + Network) in order to facilitate more connection among UW-Madison students. With two other students, we conducted user research, created user personas, user flows, wireframes, and finally created a working, interactive prototype in Figma. These are some of the main screens we created. </figcaption>
