	<p> <strong>Nice to meet you!</strong> I am a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison majoring in Communication Arts. I am pursuing minors in Business, Graphic Design, and Digital Studies. In my free time, I love to draw, read, take care of succulents, and play video games. I have experience working as an SEO and digital marketing specialist, and I am certified in Google Analytics. Some programs I have used include <em>Hubspot, Ahrefs, WordPress, Adobe CC, Canva, Microsoft suite, and Google Drive suite</em>. I hope you enjoy checking out my graphic design portfolio, resume, and my skills! </p>
	<p class="first">I am very passionate about Digital Marketing, especially content creation and writing. I love coming up with brand identities and stories to make businesses stand out. Additionaly, I enjoy creating unique value propositions (USPs) and emphasizing customer needs and wants. In the future, I would love to work on SEO content creation, social media advertising, or idea generation for clients. </p>
